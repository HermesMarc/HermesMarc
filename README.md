### Hey there, I'm Marc! 👋

I'm a mathematician by training, but arguably more of a logician by practice. As you can see below, I have done some work on the intersection of computer-verified mathematics, first-order arithmetic and computability theory, in particular making use of an approach coined _synthetic computability_.

I am currently looking for a PhD position in the area of mathematical logic, interested in continuing research on mechanized mathematics, topics like paraconsistent logics, the boundaries of the incompleteness theorems, or combinations of these themes. 

If you are interested or have any pointers for me in this regard, please feel free to contact me!
