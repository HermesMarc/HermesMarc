### Hey there, I'm Marc! 👋

I’m originally from Luxembourg, but I completed my undergraduate studies in Germany, where I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Physics and a Master’s in Mathematics. During my Master’s program, I explored a variety of fields, including Machine Learning, Probability Theory, Topology, and Logic, before focusing my thesis within an intersection with computer science, on computer-assisted theorem proving.
